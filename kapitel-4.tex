\label{kap-slope}

\section{Motivation}

To investigate basin scale sediment transport pathways, a distinct knowledge about the underlying, small scale processes is crucial. Motivated by the outcomes of studies on estuarine dynamics, which trigger sediment transport processes, the setting for a basic process study about suspended sediment transport by an oscillatory
