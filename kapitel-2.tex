\chapter{Near-bottom turbulence and sediment transport in the Western Baltic 
Sea}
\label{kap-measure}

This study addresses the question whether the deep basins in the Baltic Sea are 
purely depositional or if sediment once settled there can be transported back 
to shallower areas. Field data, including long-term moorings and 
microstructure measurements, from three cruises in three different years 
and seasons has therefore been analyzed to investigate mean current, turbulence 
and suspended sediment concentration. Measurements have been carried out on the 
transition zone from the German shore to the Arkona basin. It is found that 
net onshore transport of suspended matter originating from the Arkona basin 
takes place. Stratification asymmetries in the flow phases of an oscillatory 
up- and down-slope flow have been identified as a possible mechanism for this 
net sediment transport.

\section{Introduction}

The investigation of sediment transport patterns and the physical processes 
involved are essential for the understanding and mapping of many near bottom 
biogeochemical processes. Nutrients as well as pollutants are distributed or 
accumulated together with the sediment, which affects benthic communities and 
the exchange of dissolved substances between pore water and the overlying 
water column. Especially in coastal areas, a broad variety of hydrodynamical 
processes affect resuspension, transport, and accumulation of sediments. In 
shallow areas, wind waves govern the sediment dynamics, whilst mean flow, near 
bottom turbulence and interior stratification becomes increasingly important 
during the transition towards the deeper areas further away from the coast.

Due to negligible tidal motions, coastal areas of the Baltic 
Sea provide a good opportunity to study the interplay between waves and 
currents and their effects on sediment transport patterns. A number of previous 
studies have focused on these issues.
In the \textit{Ba}ltic Sea \textit{Sy}stem \textit{S}tudy (BASYS), the 
pathways of fine-grained sediment from the near-shore regions to the deep 
basins were investigated with the help of numerical models and field 
measurements \citep[][]{basys1, basys2, leipe2000}. The research project 
\textit{Dynamic} of \textit{N}atural and \textit{A}nthropogenic 
\textit{S}edimentation (DYNAS) investigated spatially resolved 
resuspension and transport patterns in the whole near-coastal area of the 
south-western Baltic Sea, using a numerical model 
\citep[][]{dynas1, dynas2}. These studies, amongst many others, focused mainly 
on large-scale sediment transport and the identification of erosional and 
depositional areas of the sea floor. 

Small-scale turbulent motions, which are an important 
factor for sediment 
transport processes, have not been included in the projects mentioned above. IS 
THAT RIGHT? OTHER STUDIES WITH TURBULENCE? FIRST TO STUDY NATURALLY OCCURING 
NEARBOTTOM TUEBULENCE. 
They affect the bottom shear stress that causes resuspension and determine how 
suspended matter is mixed up in the water column. In the interdisciplinary 
project The \textit{Se}rvice of sediments in German \textit{Co}stal 
\textit{S}eas (SECOS), in which the present study was carried out, these 
small-scale processes were examined with an extensive field program. This 
included ship-based turbulence micro-structure measurements and long-term 
mooring 
deployments. Using combined observations of suspended matter concentration 
from optical backscatter sensors, mean currents, waves, and turbulent motions we 
were able to study the relative effect of these processes on sediment transport 
at a number of key locations.

One of the regions where measurements were carried out was the 
transition zone from the near-coastal region to deeper parts of the Arkona 
basin north of the island 
R\"{u}gen. This region was considered as a prototypical transition area for the 
investigation of the different processes responsible for the sediment transport 
processes in the Western Baltic Sea. To our knowledge, 
no turbulence measurements with focus on sediment dynamics were carried out in 
this region so far.
 
In addition, this area provides the prerequisites for the occurrence of 
the slope-induced tidal straining process discussed in the previous chapters 
\citep[][]{UmlaufBurchard2011a, 
schulzumlauf2016}. Both the slope of the sea floor and 
interior vertical stratification are sufficient to trigger residual sediment 
transport under an oscillatory current. Although tides are negligible in the 
Baltic Sea, we discovered a distinct signal of inertial oscillations with a 
period of approximately 17~h over five day continuous 
current measurements. This setting certainly exceeds the capability of the 
one-dimensional numerical model used in \cite{schulzumlauf2016}, as the slope 
angle is changing and the vertical stratification is greatly enhanced in the 
region of the present halocline, making the problem at least two-dimensional. 
Nevertheless, sediment transport from the basin up the slope could be induced 
by slope-induced tidal straining under the conditions given in this region.
 
 The deep basins in the Baltic Sea, like the Arkona basin, are depositional 
areas. Net sedimentation can be measured, and sediment is transported from the 
coast to the basins \citep[][]{basys1, basys2}. The main question we adress in 
this study is whether this transport is directed purely one way, or if processes 
exist which can transport parts of the sediment from the deep basins back to 
shallower areas.

\section{Study Area}

The general properties of the Baltic Sea have already been discussed in the 
last chapter. Here, a brief introduction to the general hydrodynamic 
processes which govern the current system near the measurement site on the one 
hand, and the sediment distribution on the other is given.

\subsection{Hydrography and dynamics}

In \fig{studyarea}, the bathymetry of the study area and its position in the 
Western Baltic Sea is displayed. The flow patterns in this area have already 
been investigated with extensive field measurement e.g. in \cite{lass1993}. In 
a study on the Pomeranian Bight (i.e. the shallow area connecting the Arkona 
Basin in the west and the Bornholm Basin in the east and where the mouth of the 
Oder river is located), \cite{lass2001} also investigated the study site 
described here both observationally and with a high-resolution circulation 
model. In addition, the same authors carried out measurements in two consecutive 
winters in the Arkona Basin and analyzed the flow dynamics there 
\citep[][]{lass2003}. These three studies give a good insight 
of the flow patterns in the area where our investigations were performed.

 \end{figure}

Two main drivers are determining the currents. From the exchange with the North 
Sea, dense bottom currents of saline water flows into the Arkona Basin. 
Coriolis effects form a topographically trapped dense rim current which rotates 
cyclonically around the basin, following the slope. As inflow events are 
driven by larger scale wind forcing, this process is not steady, and the 
dense bottom current can disappear completely. Parts of the saline bottom water 
are transferred from the cyclonic bottom current to the saline bottom water 
pool. ADD INFOS ABOUT the interplay between sporadic smaller inflow events and 
salt water drainage toward the Bornholm Basin (drainage time scale is of the 
order of a month) determine the position of the halocline FROM THE TWO PAPERS 
LARS SUGGESTED. The barotropic 
cyclonic motion performs basin wide zonal oscillations on timescales of one 
week \citep[][]{lass2003}.

Near-shore currents reveal an elliptical motions, with the main axis 
being aligned along the isobaths \citep[][]{lass2003} WAS GENAU PASSIERT DA?. 
North of the island 
R\"{u}gen, the currents are slightly more pronounced towards the east. The 
cross-shore component is generally weaker, but still on the order of 
0.1~m~s$^{-1}$ \citep[][]{lass1993}. 

The other main factor determining the flow conditions is local wind forcing, 
that causes upwelling and downwelling near the shore. HIER IST NOCH WAS 
FALSCH. GENAU NACHSEHEN, VOLKER FRAGEN, SAGEN, DASS UPWELLING AUCH IN 
UNSEREN DATEN ZU SEHEN IST. Wind from the east drives 
a long-shore current to the west. In cross-shore direction, Ekman 
transport causes surface flow to be directed seaward. This induces a 
near-bottom return current towards the land \citep[][]{lass1993}. The salt 
water pool in the Arkona basin is consequently tilted upwards towards the 
southern rim of the basin \citep[][]{lass2003}. During wind from the west, the 
situation is reversed.

\subsection{Sedimentology}\label{sedmol}

  Sediment distribution in this area is heterogeneous in the shallow regions 
with predominately medium to fine sand. At water depths below 25 - 30~m in the 
Arkona Basin, sediment is finer and consists homogeneously of silt 
(\fig{tauberkarte}). In the vicinity of TW, a special type of fine grained and 
organically poor sediment is found. Previous studies \citep[][]{leipe2000, 
basys1} found the Arkona Basin to be a deposition center for material 
originating from the shallower areas, with accumulation rates of around 2.2 
mm/yr. Sediment characteristics in the Arkona Basin resemble those of a 
fluffy layer, implying that sediment is easily resuspended and, due to its low 
settling 
velocity, remains suspended for a relatively long period of time ZITAT UND 
MEHR INFORMATION ZUM SEDIMENT, TAUC ETC. A consecutive 
study \citep[][]{basys2} found the 20~m isobath to be the border between 
erosional and depositional sites in this area, suggesting that the Tromper Wiek 
region is depositional as well. These authors also pointed out that muddy 
sediments accumulated below the halocline in this region.

\section{Instrumentation}

We obtained hydrographic and turbulence data at 
several locations throughout the German coastal area during three cruises with 
R/V \textit{Alkor} in spring 2014 (AL434, 28.03.-08.04.2014), R/V 
\textit{Elisabeth Mann Borgese} in spring 2015 (EMB100, 09.04.-16.04.2015) and 
R/V \textit{Maria S. Merian} in winter 2016 (MSM50, 05.01.-29.01.2016). Here, 
we exclusively discuss data obtained in the transition zone from the coast off 
the island R\"{u}gen (called Tromper Wiek (TW), around 30~m water depth) to 
the approximately 45~m deep Arkona Basin (AB). The exact positions of deployed 
moorings and ship-based microstructure profiler transects are indicated in 
\fig{studyarea}.

LOOK EEFKES PAPER FOR HOW SAMPLING INTERVALS ETC WERE DESCRIBED. ONLY 
DESCRIBE WHAT WAS REALLY USED? Three different types of moorings were deployed: 
A CTD-Chain consisted of eight 
CTD-loggers (MicroCat from Seabird, USA), tied to a mooring line at intervals 
of 1 m, starting at 1 m above the seabed, additionally two optical 
backscatter sensors (NTU from Wetlabs, USA) at 3.5 and 5.5 m above the seabed. 
For the EMB100 cruise, the CTD-Chain was extended to 10 CTD-loggers (5 MicroCat 
and 5 TR-1060 type from RBR, Canada) and the turbidity sensors were omitted. 
Lander 1 was a bottom-mounted instrument frame with an upward looking 1200 kHz 
ADCP (Teledyne RDI, USA), a 6 MHz single-point Doppler current meter (Vector 
from Nortek AS, Norway), another CTD-logger and a turbidity sensor. Lander 2 
was a similar bottom frame equipped with an upward looking 600 MHz ADCP 
(Teledyne RDI, USA) and an upward looking 1 MHz (2 MHz during cruise AL434) 
pulse-coherent ADCP (Aquadopp HR from Nortek AS, Norway). For the cruises 
EMB100 and MSM50, Lander 2 was complemented with an additional CTD-logger and a 
turbidity sensor. Deployment times of the moorings are listed in 
\tab{deployments}.

Ship-based microstructure measurements were performed with a MSS90-L 
microstructure profiler (ISW, Germany). The instrument contained a set of 
precision CTD sensors, a fast FP07 thermistor, a turbidity sensor, and two 
airfoil shear-probes. During the transects (each of 1 to 5 hours duration) the 
ship moved at 1-2 kn and profiles were obtained continously. Number and time of 
the transects for each cruise are summarized in \tab{mss}.

\section{Observations}

Obtained data are shown in the following, starting with measurements from the 
deep parts of the Arkona basin to understand the structure of the water 
column there. After that, a 13~km turbulence microstrucure profiler transect 
onshore towards shallower areas is discussed. Finally, data from moored 
instruments deployed near TW for several days are displayed and analyzed.

\subsection{Arkona Basin}

 During each of the three cruises AL434, EMB076 and MSM50, we collected 
microstructure data in the Arkona Basin. \fig{abmss} shows the profiles of 
dissipation rate and turbidity, averaged over all profiles obtained in the 
basin for each cruise. A turbulent bottom boundary layer (BBL) is visible in 
all three profiles, ranging from 1 to 5 m thickness. 
Turbidity is enhanced in the BBL, but not above, suggesting that the suspended 
sediment causing this turbidity originates from the sea floor. As these 
measurements were performed over three years and in different 
seasons, it is most likely that this turbid, very sharply defined BBL is 
constantly present in the Arkona Basin.

   \begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{bilder/arkona_mss.pdf}
 \caption{Turbidity and dissipation rate from all microstructure transect in 
the Arkona Basin. Solid lines are mean values, dashed line the standard 
deviation. Only the lowermost part of the water column is displayed here.}
 \label{abmss}
 \end{figure}

The above yields that, on the one hand, suspended sediment transported to the 
Arkona basin does not necessarily settle there, but is either held in 
suspension or occasionally resuspended and mixed into the turbulent BBL. This 
is in agreement with previous studies that found the sediment in the basin to 
be fluff-like, easily resuspended and slowly settling, see section 
\ref{sedmol}. On the other hand, this reservoir of fine grained 
suspended sediment has the potential to be advectively 
transported across the rim of the Arkona basin into the shallower areas by 
onshore currents. Under the conditions of present oscillatory currents, 
interior vertical stratification and a bottom slope discussed in the previous 
sections, the Arkona basin could be a source of sediment to be transported 
up-slope in the process of slope-induced tidal straining.

\subsection{Transect from basin to the coast}

In \fig{transect} it is visible how the water body is structured along the 
slope from the basin onto the coast. A sharp halocline separates a turbulent 
BBL of approximately 5~m thickness from the interior. This 
data was obtained in January 2016. At the southern end of the transect, where 
the slope angle steepens, the halocline is widened where it approaches the sea 
floor. 

The boundary layer is generally turbid. Turbidity is more patchy towards the 
shallow areas, but high values are confined to the bottom boundary layer, 
so no suspended matter is mixed across the halocline. This indicates again that 
turbidity is caused by material originating from the sea floor and held in 
suspension by turbulent motions in the BBL.

The turbulent dissipation rate is also enhanced in the BBL. In the area where 
the halocline encounters the sea bed on the steep slope, dissipation is 
suppressed by the high stratification. Further up the slope, right above the 
halocline, there is again an area with greatly enhanced dissipation. This 
yields that sediment could be resuspended locally when the halocline is 
advected up the slope. This is supported by slightly enhanced turbidity values 
in this region. However, measured turbidity below the halocline exceeds these 
values by more than a factor of two.

Isolines of salinity (please note that salinity mainly determines the density 
in this region) below the halocline are tilted towards the bottom, consistent 
with the observations of boundary layers over sloping topography in e.g. 
\cite{Lorkeetal2005a}. Shear induced convection and, in the presence of an 
oscillatory current, residual (upslope) sediment transport as described in 
\cite{schulzumlauf2016} is consequently within the realms of possibility here.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=40pc]{bilder/abtrans.png}
 \caption{Turbidity and dissipation rate from the microstructure transect T1 
in January 2016. White lines indicate levels of equal salinity.}
 \label{transect}
 \end{figure}
 
 Although this transect is just a snapshot of the situation in January 
2016, there are several indicators that these conditions are usually present 
here: Turbulent and turbid boundary layers have been visible on all 
microstructure transects in the Arkona basin in three years (see above section), 
and the regional halocline is constantly present (ZITAT), although the extension 
of the dense bottom water pool might differ. Consequently, his transect gives 
an idea of the structure of the water column along the basin to coast transect.
  
\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Tromper Wiek}

In the data from the onshore transect in the last section, it was visible that 
high turbidity values, present throughout the BBL, reach out to water depths 
well below 35~m. In this section, data from instruments deployed at 29~m, 
resembling the shallow end of the transect, were displayed. This data was 
obtained in April 2014, nearly two years before measurements for transect T1 
were performed. However, as the structure of the water body was similar during 
all three cruises, the general situation during the two measurement is 
presumably comparable.

During the 5 day instrument deployment a wind event with wind 
speeds up to force 7 and up to 4 m wave height was captured, followed by a calm 
period (\fig{tromperwiek}a). In \fig{tromperwiek}b the variance of the 
horizontal velocity components filtered WIE GENAU?? What filter was used? What 
do these filter periods make sense? Data are based on which instrument? At what 
height above the bottom? ... for wave periods between 2 and 20 
seconds, which is proportional to the kinetic energy contained in the 
waves, is displayed. Although wave energy was maximum in the afternoon of 
04 April 2016, the peak in turbidity was not reached until late morning of 
05 April. This 
suggests that local resuspension during the wind event did not occur, but that 
a turbid 
water mass was advected to the measurement site. Near-bottom currents 
(\fig{tromperwiek}c) were directed south during the relevant period, 
i.e. water from deeper parts was advected up the slope.

 \begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{bilder/al434tw.pdf}
 \caption{(A) Wind speed and direction from the hindcast of the German Weather 
Service, (B) wave energy and turbidity and (C) direction of

cruise AL434 (April 2014). Each black horizontal line in (a) indicates a 
microstructure transect carried out in the vicinity of the deployed mooring.}
 \label{tromperwiek}
 \end{figure}
 
 This advection of saline water near the bottom was likely triggered by the 
local wind 
forcing. Strong easterly wind causes Ekman transport to the north (i.e. 
offshore) in the surface layer \citep[][]{lass2001}, \textbf{You could compute 
the Ekman transport from the wind stress, and devide the result by the observed 
surface layer thickness. This would yield an Ekman-related velocity that you 
could compare to your observations.} which is visible in the 
velocity data from the 600~kHz ADCP mounted on Lander~2, displayed in 
\fig{adcp600}. [Corrupted velocity measurements in the uppermost part of the 
water column during 04 April coincide with the periods when strong surface 
waves were recorded with the ADV. These problems most likely originate from 
air bubbles entrained by breaking waves. IN FOOTNOTE] The near-bottom return 
current below 
17~m depth exhibits a clear near-inertial signal, super-imposed on a southerly 
(i.e. onshore) mean current during the storm. Maximum onshore bottom currents 
were reached by the beginning of 05 April. After wind collapsed and changed 
direction at the end of 05 April, the surface currents 
first decayed and then reversed to southerly directions. Near-bottom 
currents remained unsteady with a mean easterly component. This is more clearly 
visible from \fig{tromperwiek}c.

 \begin{figure}[ht]

 \caption{Time series of velocity profiles obtained with the 600~kHz ADCP on 
Lander 2 during the deployment at TW on cruise AL434 (April 2014).}
 \label{adcp600}
 \end{figure}

 In the CTD Chain data in \fig{ctdchain} we see an increase of the 
near-bottom salinity, accompanied by increasing turbidity, starting in the 
afternoon of 04 April. The increase in turbidity is clearly linked to the 
increase of salinity, supporting the idea that turbid water is advected to 
position TW from deeper 
regions. Furthermore, salinity data in the record reaches a level that 
resembles the saline bottom waters in the Arkona basin below the 
halocline REFERENZ TS DIAGRAMM. This indicates that upwelling 
tilted the halocline towards the south and saline bottom water reached far 
upslope to the shore.

\section{Discussion}

This study focusses on finding processes which can transport sediment upslope 
from the deep basins back to shallower areas. We have found from the 
microstructure measurements in the Arkona basin, that in spite of the depth and 
therefore the absence of wave-induced resuspension, a layer of 
suspended fine-grained sediment is present near the bottom. This yields that 
sediment that is transported into the basin can be held in suspension there 
or can be resuspended once it is deposited there.

We furthermore found that this turbid and turbulent BBL is present everywhere 
along the slope, confined by a regional halocline. This near bottom pool of 
saline water with high concentrations of suspended matter is not in rest, but 
advected up- and down the slope by upwelling events and inertial oscillations. 
Sediment originating from the deep parts of the basin can therefore be 
transported on-shore over several kilometers. In the upwelling situation 
discussed above, the integrated near bottom velocity yielded an up slope 
transport over a distance of more than 8 kilometers in less than 24 hours. 

What can not be answered from the observations is whether suspended sediment 
that is transported up the slope settles there and a net upslope transport of 
sediment occurs. A process that induces net sediment transport across sloping 
topography is slope-induced tidal straining. The prerequisites for this 
process, namely vertical stratification, sloping topography and an oscillatory 
current, are all present in the study area. 

From the non-dimensional description of the process in \cite{schulzumlauf2016}, 
we can infer which settling velocity, and consequently which kind of sediment, 
is favored for up-slope transport. Sediment transport was found 
to be enhanced for non-dimensional settling velocities of $P= w_s \slash U = 
10^{-2}$. Here, $w_s$ is the settling velocity of suspended sediment and $U$ 
the magnitude of the oscillatory flow. Cross-slope flow velocities are in the 
order of 0.1~m~s$^{-1}$ in this region \citep[][]{lass1993}, yielding that 
sediment with a settling velocity of $w_s=10^{-3}$~m~s$^{-1}$ is favored for 
up-slope transport under the conditions investigated in this study. After 
Stokes law, this settling velocity corresponds to medium to coarse silt. As 
visible in \fig{tauberkarte}, this is exactly the sediment present in this 
area. Along the transect T1, indicated in \fig{studyarea}, sediment 
distribution ranges from fine silt in the basin to coarse silt near the shore. 
Additionally, sorting of the sediment is better near-shore than in the basin. 
Both indicates the occurrence of residual sediment transport by slope-induced 
tidal straining here.

Another indicator for sediment transport out of the basin is the distribution 
of mercury in this region. In the Arkona basin, ammunition was dumped during 
World War II. This resulted in a heavy contamination of the sediment with 
mercury. As visible in \fig{hg}, the dumping site in the eastern part of the 
Arkona Basin can be identified from mercury concentrations of over 400~$\mu$g 
kg$^{-1}$. The near bottom mean flow by saline North Sea water progressing 
through the basins is from west to east here, which explains the spreading of 
mercury to the east. The cyclonic rim current can distribute mercury 
contaminated sediment along the rim of the basin. But mercury concentrations 
are also enhanced in shallower parts of the basin, yielding that sediment is 
also transported from deeper to shallower parts, across the isobaths. One 
possible mechanism inducing this transport is slope-induced tidal straining.

\section{Conclusions}

One of the most important findings of this study is that sediment once 
deposited in the Arkona basin can be transported back onshore. 
This yields that fine-grained sediment from all the deep basins in the Baltic 
Sea, which are considered to be purely depositional, can be exported to 
shallower areas. This has great implications on the distribution of pollutants, 
like the mercury originating from the ammunition dumping site in the Arkona 
basin. Pollutants accumulated in the deep basins are not confined to remain 
there, but can spread towards shallower areas where they can endanger the local 
biosystem.

Several different mechanism cause sediment transport in the Arkona basin. 
Firstly, the mean flow of 
the dense bottom current spreads suspended sediment to the east while it 
propagates through the basin structure of the Baltic Sea. Additionally, the 
cyclonic rim current distributes sediment along the isobaths inside the basin. 
Secondly, upwelling tilts the bottom water pool towards the shore and saline 
water from the deep is advected up the basin slope, accompanied by 
suspended sediment originating from the deep parts of the basin. From the data, 
we can not determine whether this advected sediment is deposited in the 
shallower parts, or if it disappears to the deeper areas again along with the 
saline water mass. Finally, evidences are given that oscillatory currents 
in cross-slope direction, which have been identified not only in our 
observations, can cause a residual sediment transport induces by asymmetries in 
stratification and consequently vertical turbulent mixing as described in 
\cite{schulzumlauf2016}. Observed slope angle and vertical density 
stratification are well within the range which promote up-slope sediment 
transport. Sediment distribution on the transect from basin to the coast is in 
agreement with the type of sediment (characterized by sediment settling 
velocity) that would be favored for up-slope transport under the observed 
conditions. Furthermore, the results found in section \ref{kap-jgr} yield that 
a dominant along-slope velocity component, which is present here, does not 
hinder the residual up-slope sediment transport.

Even though the occurrence of residual sediment transport by slope-induced tidal 
straining can not be definitely proven from the observations, many indicators 
for this process are given. Conclusively, we can say that the transport 
mechanism described in \cite{schulzumlauf2016} is likely to take place under 
the given circumstances in the Arkona basin and can explain not only the 
spreading of mercury but also the distribution of sediment in this area.
