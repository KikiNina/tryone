\section{Study Area and Instrumentation}

We obtained hydrographic and turbulence data at 
several locations throughout the German coastal area during three cruises with 
R/V \textit{Alkor} in spring 2014 (AL434, 28.03.-08.04.2014), R/V 
\textit{Elisabeth Mann Borgese} in spring 2015 (EMB100, 09.04.-16.04.2015) and 
R/V \textit{Maria S. Merian} in winter 2016 (MSM50, 05.01.-29.01.2016). Here, 
we exclusively discuss data obtained in the transition zone from the coast off 
the island R\"{u}gen (called Tromper Wiek (TW), water depth at the deployment 
location was 29 m) to 
the approximately 45 m deep Arkona Basin (AB). The exact positions of deployed 
moorings and ship-based microstructure profiler transects are indicated in 
\fig{studyarea}.

Sediment distribution in this area is heterogeneous in the shallow regions with 
predominately medium to fine sand. At water depths below 25 - 30 m in the 
Arkona Basin, sediment is finer and consists homogeneously of silt 
(\fig{tauberkarte}). Previous studies \citep[][]{leipe2000, basys1} found 
the Arkona Basin to be a deposition center for material orginiating from the 
shallower areas, with accumulation rates of around 2.2 mm/yr. Sediment 
characteristics in the Arkona Basin resemble to those of a fluffy layer, i.e. 
it is easily resuspended and, due to its low settling velocity, remains 
suspended for a relatively long period of time. A consecutive study 
\citep[][]{basys2} found the 20m isobath to be the border between erosional and 
depositional sites in this area, yielding the Tromper Wiek region to be 
depositional as well. This study pointed out, that muddy sediments accumulated 
below the halocline in this region.

Three different types of moorings were deployed: A CTD-Chain consisted of eight 
CTD-loggers (MicroCat from Seabird, USA), tied to a mooring line at intervals 
of 1 m, starting at 1 m above the seabed, additionally two optical 
backscatter sensors (NTU from Wetlabs, USA) at 3.5 and 5.5 m above the seabed. 
For the EMB100 cruise, the CTD-Chain was extended to 10 CTD-loggers (5 MicroCat 
and 5 TR-1060 type from RBR, Canada) and the turbidity sensors were omitted. 
Lander 1 was a bottom-mounted instrument frame with an upward looking 1200 kHz 
ADCP (Teledyne RDI, USA), a 6 MHz single-point Doppler current meter (Vector 
from Nortek AS, Norway), another CTD-logger and a turbidity sensor. Lander 2 
was a similar bottom frame equipped with an upward looking 600 MHz ADCP 
(Teledyne RDI, USA) and an upward looking 1 MHz (2 MHz during cruise AL434) 
pulse-coherent ADCP (Aquadopp HR from Nortek AS, Norway). For the cruises 
EMB100 and MSM50, Lander 2 was complemented with an additional CTD-logger and a 
turbidity sensor. Deployment times of the moorings are listed in 
\tab{deployments}.

Ship-based microstructure measurements were performed with a MSS90-L 
microstructure profiler (ISW, Germany). The instrument contained a set of 
precision CTD sensors, a fast FP07 thermistor, a turbidity sensor, and two 
airfoil shear-probes. During the transects (1 to 5 hours duration) the ship 
moved at 1-2 kn and profiles were obtained continously. Number and time of the 
transects for each cruise are summarized in \tab{mss}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Tromper Wiek}

During the 5 day instrument deployment in 2014 (\tab{deployments}), we captured 
a storm event with 7 Bft wind and up to 4 m wave height with a consecutive calm 
period (\fig{tromperwiek}, A). In \fig{tromperwiek}, B a proxy for the wave 
energy, the variance of the horizontal velocity components, filtered 
for wave periods between 2 and 20 seconds, is displayed. Although wave energy 
was maximal in the afternoon of April 4, the peak in turbidity was not reached 
until late morning of April, 5. This yields that local resuspension during 
storm did not occur, but a turbid watermass was advected to the measurement 
site. Near bottom current (\fig{tromperwiek},C) was directed to the south 
during the relevant period, i.e. water from deeper parts was advected up the 
slope.

Service, (B) wave energy and turbidity and (C) direction of

AL434.}

 \end{figure}
 
In the CTD Chain data in \fig{ctdchain} we see a steady increase of the 
near-bottom salinity, accompanied by increasing turbidity.

 \end{figure}
 

\subsection{Transect}

In \fig{transect} we see how the water body is structured along the slope from 
the coast into the basin. A sharp halocline seperates a turbulent bottom 
boundary layer (BBL) of approximately 5 m from the interior. At the left hand 
side of the pannel, where the slope angle steepens, the halocline is widened. 
The boundary layer is generally turbid: Turbidity is more patchy at the upper 
parts of the slope, but high values are confined to the bottom boundary layer, 
so no suspended matter is mixed across the halocline. This indicates that 
turbidity is caused by material originating from the seafloor and held in 
suspension by turbulent motions in the BBL.
Salinity isolines are rather parallel to the slope than straight horizontal, 
what would be the stably stratified case.

 \label{transect}
 \end{figure}


\subsection{Arkona Basin}

During each of the three cruises, we collected microstructure data in the 
Arkona Basin. \fig{abmss} shows the profiles of dissipation rate and turbidity, 
averaged over all profiles obtained at the basin for each cruise. A turbulent 
BBL is visible in all three profiles, ranging from 1 to 5 m thickness. 
Turbidity is again enhanced in the BBL, but not above, supporting the data 
described in the last section. As this data set was obtained over three years 
and in different seasons, it is most likely that this turbid, very sharp 
defined BBL is constantly present in the Arkona Basin.
